Simple git log plugin for Gerrit.

The upcoming 2.5 release of Gerrit will have support for plugins, this
is a small attempt of introducing "git log" plugin.

Main use case is for teams that need to data mine the git repositories
maintained by Gerrit in an easy way. Especially if you have big
repositories where it is not feasible to clone them.
